# example 1 | The index starts at 0 and goes up to 4

# print('My name is')
# i = 0 
# while i < 5:
#     print('Jimmy Five Times ' + str(i))
#     i = i + 1 

# print('My name is')
# for i in range(5):
#     print('Jimmy Five Times ' + str(i)) 

# example 2 | range goes from 0 to n-1

# total = 0
# for num in range(101):
#     total = total + num
# print(total)

# example 3 | deeper into the range function
#           | range(m,n) goes from m to n-1
#           | range(m,n,h) goes from m to n-1 in hops of h, for any 
#           | if h < 0 than the range goes in the opposit direction
#           | h must be an integer !=0.
print('My name is')
for i in range(5, -1, -1):
    print('Jimmy Five Times ' + str(i))

# break and continue work in for loops the same as while loops
